<h1 align="center">Welcome! We are chaBotsMX</h1>

![](https://github.com/chaBotsMX/.github/blob/main/profile/chaBotsPhoto.png)

An independent student robotics group based in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. We believe competitions are the best way to learn robotics. We have been participating in Robotics competitions such as World Robot Olympiad, RoboCup, MakeX, OMI and TMR since 2015.

We see our participation in these prestigious tournaments not only as an opportunity for us to display our technical abilities, but also as a way to execute our mission of generating interest and spreading knowledge in the area of STEM and educational robotics in México.
